               <h2>3D Printing</h2>
               <p id="testP"  class="funParagraph">When I first started getting into 3D printing I did not know what I was getting myself into as to many of my other hobbies. I didn't need to get one but only for the fact I wanted to make a Spider-Man mask faceshell for halloween. So one day I was at my local microcenter and bought my first printer out the blue. It was the Ender 3 v2. It was a lot smaller than I thought, but it got the job done. Took me a while to set it up at first but once I got it going I was off printing my Spider-Man faceshell. After months I decided I needed, more like wanted, a bigger printer. So  thats when I decied to pick the CR-10s Pro V2. A much bigger printer. I was able to print much bigger items which was very nice to do. Currently I am dumping money into both of the to upgrade their currents parts to print better.</p>

               <h2>Project Car 2001 Ford Mustang</h2>
               <p>Back during 2020 I had a lot of time to myself to really think what I wanted to start doing with my spare time. Then one day my dad asked me to watch the Fast and the Furious, and then the spark came to me. I wanted a project car. I didn't know anything about cars at the time so the only car I really wanted was a 99-04 Mustang due to the face my mom had a 04 Mustang when I was younger. It didn't take me long to find one off Facebook marketplace.Next thing I know I bought the car for $1300. Not a care in the world. I learned so much in this car.How to drive stick, and how to fix issues that came up. Now it is just sitting in my garage while I try to save whatever money I have to put a bigger and better engine in it.</p>

               <h2>PC Building and My Setup </h2>
               <p>Growing up I didn't have a computer. So when I was first introduced to one at my cousin's house I was hooked. I was about 7 years old when I first used and I wanted my own. By the time I was about 12 my parents got a computer for work stuff. Unfortunately it was nowhere near powerful enough to even run minecraft. Years went by,it's now 2016 and all my friends started getting gaming PC's and I was stucked playing on my xbox. I told my dad that I watned to build one and he was confused that he didn't know we can build our own. So he put his trust in me to build a gaming PC. I did a ton of research and found what parts work together. A month later I had all the parts I need to build my PC. Took me 8 hours to get it done, But when it was done it was the best thing I could ever ask for. Ever since that first PC, I've built  about another 8 more. With 3 of them being for myself. And for some reason I keep on putting more and more into it and all I do is play League of Legends.</p>
